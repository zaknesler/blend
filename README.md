**blend** _[wip]_ is a lightweight, self-hosted RSS reader application written in Rust and Solid.js. It is heavily inspired by [yarr](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr), and is a single binary that you can run wherever. This project is under heavy development and doesn't even do anything RSS-related yet.
